Day-Planner
Description
I built a very simple day planner to learn a little bit more about Day.js and some simple bootstrap. The bigges thing that helped me out was learning I could make the time blocks using Day.js and not having to build them out myself.

Installation
Just clone the code and it should work.

Usage
Anyone can use this code and build off of it.
